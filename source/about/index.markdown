Welcome!  My name is Gary Green.  I’m a software developer primarily focused on Microsoft products. I’ve been developing professionally since the early 2000′s. Most of my career has been spent developing payment websites and IVR(Interactive Voice Response) systems.

I am working as a consultant for [Randstand Technologies](http://technologies.randstadusa.com/).  My current contract, started in January 2012 is at Quad/Graphics working on some very cool new web projects.
